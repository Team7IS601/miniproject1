One important factor to increase efficiency and productivity in development is to be familiar with essential tools. Git is necessary to track and maintain code specially on team work. Git provide the hundreds of comments and configuration which every developer might face in day to day work life.Knowing your everyday tool set increases your productivity as a developer. And Git is one of those tools you use on a daily basis

What is Git?  
Git is a version control system that most software developers would have heard of. It’s the tool of choice for the team behind the Linux kernel and comes with the associated prestige and sets a high floor for the technical competence of its users.
Git has a steep learning curve as it’s incredibly flexible and the web is splattered with inconsistent information about using it. The trouble is that often the people that write and talk enthusiastically about Git are hardcore programmer-types that espouse attributes that aren’t really important or valuable out of their context (“free, open source and distributed”). If you ask whether it increases productivity compared to the alternatives? Then yes, it helps, a lot.

Productivity  
Compared to the alternatives, Git increases the productivity of your team members when they need to manage multiple versions of their stuff. Stuff, meaning the code and config for developers, images and documents for designers. It’s a content version system for their working set. Critically, especially for developers, is that it allows users to quickly switch context between the set of code they’re currently working with to any other branch or version, in a moment, with no fear of losing what their working on, and no fear of corrupting other versions. This is a significant time-saver. They’ll love it.

Competitiveness   
lies in the ability to use Git and be competent at it. Git is one of the more popular version control systems and it is a staple tool for programming. To ensure a company stays competitive it must rely on these essential programming tools that are learned and used in other companies. With a company using Git it is assured that it will reach a level of productivity and competitiveness that is needed to be successful.
