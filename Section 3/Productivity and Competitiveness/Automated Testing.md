## Automated Testing  
What does Automated Testing mean?
Automated testing or test automation is a method in software testing that makes use of special software tools to control the execution of tests and then compares actual test results with predicted or expected results. All of this is done automatically with little or no intervention from the test engineer. Automation is used to to add additional testing that may be too difficult to perform manually.

###### Productivity/ Competitiveness
The key advantages to automated testing include helping businesses stay competitive and productive in the following ways:  
- Saving time and money by making testing more efficient  
- Improves testing accuracy compared to testing directed by humans  
- Increases test coverage because multiple testing tools can be deployed at once allowing for parallel testing of different test scenarios  
- Helps developers by finding bugs and errors more quickly
