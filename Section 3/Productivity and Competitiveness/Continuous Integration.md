## Continuous Integration
What is Continuous Integration exactly?
Continous Inegration (CI) is a practice in web development in which developers integrate code into a shared repository.  A hallmark of this practice is the automatic and frequent itegration of code changes from multiple contributors using tools that will validate the new code's correctness before final integration.  

###### Productivity/ Competitiveness
There are quite a few advantages to adopting the Continuous Integration approach:
 - Eliminates the need for developers on a team to wait for release day to merge changes into the release branch.
 - Speeds up the release process by allowed teams to find and fix bugs as early as possible.
 - Allows developers to work on different parts of a project simultaneously.
