## Git in a Team Environment
- Git is extremely important because it allows a group of contributors to work on one project anywhere in the world. The convenience is the main reason why it is so popular and essential to use in projects. 
- Branches allow you to achieve different pathways when creating code and working together as a team. They are beneficial when you donâ€™t know if you want to change  something so you can create a branch and have both options. Essentially working on different versions of the same file is the main point of a Branch.
- Merging your branch into the master branch is necessary when you have completed your task and want to utilize these changes in the main branch.
