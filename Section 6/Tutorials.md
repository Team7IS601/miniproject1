## Git in a Team Environment
- Git is extremely important because it allows a group of contributors to work on one project anywhere in the world. The convenience is the main reason why it is so popular and essential to use in projects.  
- Branches allow you to achieve different pathways when creating code and working together as a team. They are beneficial when you don’t know if you want to change  something so you can create a branch and have both options. Essentially working on different versions of the same file is the main point of a Branch.
- Merging your branch into the master branch is necessary when you have completed your task and want to utilize these changes in the main branch. 

## Merging Branch Conflicts
- There can be several conflicts when merging your branch with the master branch or another branch. This link will show you the potentia problems and outcomes when merging conflicts arise.

## Forking vs Cloning
- Forking is the process of making a copy of a repository so you can make changes without affecting said repository. Forking is convenient because you can pull changes from the main repo easily. You are also connected and merging data is simple. 
- Cloning a repository creates a local copy on the system that you are using. You will not be able to pull changes from the original repo that you copied from because they are local. Cloning can be essential when you want to back up a repo.

## Pull Request 
- A pull request is an awesome part of git. Once a contributor makes changes they can submit these changes to the main repo via a pull request. A pull request is considered a work flow method. You essentially create a pull request to transfer changes made by contributors to repos so that the main repo contains everyone's contributions.
