## Repo
Repo is a tool built on top of Git. Repo helps manage many Git repositories, does the uploads to revision control systems, and automates parts of the development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git. The repo command is an executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path.

## Clone  
git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. In this page we'll discuss extended configuration options and common use cases of git clone. Git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location.

## Fork
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

Propose changes to someone else's project

A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

Fork the repository.
Make the fix.
Submit a pull request to the project owner.
If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!

Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

At the heart of open source is the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software.

When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others.

## Branch
Whenever you propose a change in Git, you create a new branch. Branch management is an important part of the Git workflow. After some time, your list of branches may grow, so it's a good idea to delete merged or stale branches.

[Setting the default branch→](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch)

The default branch is considered the base branch in your repository, against which all pull requests and code commits are automatically made, unless you specify a different branch.

[Viewing branches in your repository→](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/viewing-branches-in-your-repository)

Branches are central to collaboration on GitHub, and the best way to view them is the branches page.

[Deleting and restoring branches in a pull request→](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/deleting-and-restoring-branches-in-a-pull-request)

If you have write access in a repository, you can delete branches that are associated with closed or merged pull requests. You cannot delete branches that are associated with open pull requests.
