## Repo


Repo is a tool built on top of Git. Repo helps manage many Git repositories, does the uploads to revision control systems, and automates parts of the development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git. The repo command is an executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path.

## Clone  
git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. In this page we'll discuss extended configuration options and common use cases of git clone. Git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location.

##Fork
A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

Propose changes to someone else's project

A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:

Fork the repository.
Make the fix.
Submit a pull request to the project owner.
If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!

Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

At the heart of open source is the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software.

When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others.
