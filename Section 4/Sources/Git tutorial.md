###### The GitHub Flow

The GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands used by teams around the globe—including ours.

The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:

1. Create a branch: Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch (usually master) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.  

2. Add commits: Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.  

3. Open a pull request: Pull requests publicize a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.  

4. Discuss and review code: Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.  

5. Merge: Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.  

6. Deploy: Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.
